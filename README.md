# Population III Stellar Evolution with MESA

This repository contains stellar evolution models of **Population III (zero-metallicity)** stars computed using the MESA code.  
The project explores the **internal structure, convection dynamics, and nucleosynthesis** of massive primordial stars over a wide mass range.

## Overview

- **Mass range:** 10 – 25 M⊙  
- **Nuclear Networks used:** `mesa_128.net` and `approx21.net`  
- **Convection criterion:** Ledoux (except test runs with Schwarzschild)  
- **Convective boundary mixing (CBM) values:** 3.4 – 5.0, with selected models.  
- **Mass loss:** Included in all runs  

The models investigate how convection, CBM strength, and mixing-length treatment affect the late-stage evolution and pre-supernova structure of metal-free stars.
